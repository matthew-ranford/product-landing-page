# Product Landing Page

This is a basic product landing page that gave me an intro into using Bootstrap & Saas. 

## Setup
### Installation 
To use, consider these steps:

- Fork this repo
- Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`.
